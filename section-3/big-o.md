## Interview - Big O

- How well the a problem is solved?
- How much time and space does it take to solve a problem?


# What is a good code?
  - Readable
  - Scalable

Big-o is a way to measure how much scalable our code is.

We can provide instructions to a computer, but this instructions to solve the problem, can be different. We can have different ways to solve the same problem. Check the example 1 file.

# Big O and Scalability

Time to run a code is different for different computers. So, we can't measure the time to run a code. We can measure the number of operations that a code does.

In example-2 we have a array with 10000 entries, and the time to run the code is different for different computers. But the number of operations is the same.

Big O notation is a way to measure the number of operations that a code does.

This is the example below of a  list of complexity notation: 

- O(n!) -> Horrible
- O(2^n) -> Horrible
- O(n^2) -> Horrible
- O(n log n) -> Bad
- O(n) -> Bad
- O(log n) -> Fair
- O(1) -> Good
