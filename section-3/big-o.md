## Interview - Big O

- How well the a problem is solved?
- How much time and space does it take to solve a problem?


# What is a good code?
  - Readable
  - Scalable

Big-o is a way to measure how much scalable our code is.

We can provide instructions to a computer, but this instructions to solve the problem, can be different. We can have different ways to solve the same problem. Check the example 1 file.
